Based off of Animal Crossing's Garden feature, this project allows players to plant and harvest flowers for coins, which correlate to the final score. 

Players have 10 days, each day represented by a decision, to plant, water, and harvest flowers. During that 10 day period they are responsible for ensuring that plants are harvested within two days of blooming and watered when needed. Each plant choice (sunflower, hibiscus, and cherry blossom) bloom after different numbers of and required different amounts of water. The longer the bloom period and more the plant needs to be watered, the more money it is worth.

Game Instructions: 

Hey there {user_name}! 

    this game is an optimization game.

    You will have 10 days to make the most money you can. Each decision you make represents a day.

    You make money by 🌱 growing, harvesting, and 💰selling  bloomed flowers. 

    In order for flowers to bloom, they must be watered💦 when needed. Otherwise, they will  die. ❌ ❌

    Flowers that are not harvested within 2 days of blooming will also die. ❌ ❌

    Flower prices are based on how long they take to bloom and how much they need to be watered💦.

    there are three flowers: 
                        sunflowers 🌻 can be sold for  3 dollars.
                                hibuscuses 🌺 can be sold for 6 dollars.
                                    cherry blossoms 🌸 can be sold for 10 dollars.
